		<em><b>Diameter</b></em><br><br>
		<p>Diameter of a network is the maximal distance(shortest path) amongst all the distance calculated between each couple of vertices in the graph.
		The diameter indicates how much distant are the two most distant nodes. It can be be a first
		and simple general parameter of graph "compactness". A “high” graph diameter indicates that the
		two nodes determining that diameter are very distant, implying little graph compactness.
		However, it is possible that two nodes are very distant, thus giving a high graph diameter, but
		several other nodes are not. Therefore, a graph could have high diameter and
		still being rather compact or have very compact regions. Thus, a high graph diameter can be
		misleading in term of evaluation of graph compactness. In contrast a “low” graph diameter
		is much more informative and reliable. Indeed, a low diameter surely indicates that all the
		nodes are in proximity and the graph is compact. In quantitative terms, “high” and “low”
		are better defined when compared to the total number of nodes in the graph. Thus, a low
		diameter of a very big graph (with hundreds of nodes) is much more meaningful in term of
		compactness than a low diameter of a small graph (with few nodes). Notably, the diameter
		enables to measure the development of a network in time.</p>
