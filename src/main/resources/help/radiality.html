		<em><b>Radiality</b></em><br><br>
		<p>The radiality is a node centrality index. The radiality of a node v is calculated by computing
		the shortest path between the node v and all other nodes in the graph. The value of each 
		path is then subtracted by the value of the diameter +1 (?G + 1) and the resulting values are
		summated. Finally, the obtained value is divided for the number of nodes -1 (n-1). Basically,
		as the diameter is the maximal possible distance between nodes, subtracting systematically
		from the diameter the shortest paths between the node v and its neighbors will give high
		values if the paths are short and low values if the paths are long.</p>
