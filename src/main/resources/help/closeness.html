		<em><b>Closeness</b></em><br><br>
		<p>The closeness is a node centrality index. The closeness of a node v is calculated by 
		computing the shortest path between the node v and all other nodes in the graph, and then calculating
		the sum. Once this value is obtained, its reciprocal is calculated, so higher values assume a
		positive meaning in term of node proximity.</p>
