		<em><b>Stress</b></em><br><br>
		<p>The stress is a node centrality index. Stress is calculated by measuring 
		the number of shortest paths through a node. To calculate the "stress" of 
		a node v, all the shortest paths in a graph G are calculated and then the 
		number of shortest paths passing through v is counted. A "stressed" node is a 
		node traversed by a high number of shortest paths. Notably and
		importantly, a high stress values does not automatically implies that the node v is critical
		to maintain the connection between nodes whose paths are passing through it. Indeed, it is
		possible that two nodes are connected by means of other shortest paths not passing through
		the node v. </p>
