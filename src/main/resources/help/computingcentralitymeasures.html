		<em><b>Computing Centrality Measures</b></em><br><br>
		Once you have imported a dynamic network in Cytoscape 3.0, you may compute the centrality measures for each time interval to analyze the network.
		To compute the centrality measures supported by this app:<br>
		1. Apps > Dynamic Graph Metrics.<br><br>
		
		<p>Clicking on Dynamic Graph Metrics will trigger the computation of the centrality parameters. Each of the computed parameter would be stored as a
		dynamic attribute of the corresponding node which you should be able to see in the Node Table in the Table Panel. As you explore the network using 
		the slider, the Node Table which contains the centrality parameters as atttributes would also get updated.</p>
		
		<p>You should also be able to see a new tab in the Controls Panel of Cytoscape 3.0 which would comprise of:<br>
		1. Node Attributes table<br>
		2. Edge Attributes table<br>
		3. Options to Plot the selected attributes and Update Chart</p>
