		<em><b>Plotting a Chart</b></em><br><br>
		<p>In order to plot a chart with the centrality value on the Y-axis and time on the X-axis, you first need to select an attribute. You may
		select one or more attributes from the Node/Edge Attribute table in the Controls Panel of Cytoscape 3. Then you need to select the nodes/edges
		for which you want to plot the checked attributes. You may also select the nodes/edges before you check the attributes.</p>
		<p>Click on the JButton -> Plot Selected Attributes once you are done selecting the attributes and node/edges. This will open up a new tab
		in the Results Panel of Cytoscape 3.0 which would have the chart you wanted.</p>
		
		There are a number of things you can do with the chart. You may:<br>
		1. Zoom in and out of the chart.<br>
		2. View the chart in a new resizeable window by clicking on the Enlarge Chart button.<br>
		3. Save the chart by clicking on the Save Chart button.<br>
		4. Save the chart data by clicking on the Save Data button.<br>
